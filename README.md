# AttestationGenerator

An attempt to generate attestations from a phone with a remote connection
to a Virtual EC2 Machine on AWS.

It is intended to be cloned on an android through termux, on the home folder 
(the storage folder should have been setup already).

If used through a computer, be careful about the file locations.
